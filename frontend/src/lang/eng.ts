        text: `My name is Yahor, and I am a software developer from Belarus (Minsk). Since 2019, I have been living and 
        studying in Austria (Klagenfurt), where I have been pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Applied Informatics since 2020. 
        In my work, I combine technical precision with practical thinking and a strong focus on quality. I have been working 
        part-time since 2021 alongside my studies, which has helped me develop solid skills in independent work, time management, 
        and quick decision-making. In addition, I speak German and English at a B2 level, and I am always open to learning new 
        things and growing as a professional.`
